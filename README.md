Mozilla OL7 Project to build an online professional learning community around data literacy in teaching practice for educators grades 3-16 across subject areas.

Vision (2/4/19): I’m working with educators in grades 3-16 to build an online professional learning community around data literacy so that they can confidently integrate data, data skills, and data literacy instruction into their teaching practice. I’m working open because accomplishing this vision will require creating a space in which as a community we can actively leverage lessons learned from both researchers and practitioners to inform, grow, and improve our practice in collaborative and transparent ways.
