What am I doing?

The Problem:

We live in a data-driven society, yet many educators are not sure of where to start in integrating data, data skills, and data literacy into their classrooms. Also, so many edcuators have similar kinds of questions but do not have an easy way to communicate with one another about their questions or lack the confidence to pose the question. However, when integrating new things into our teaching practice we often do better when we can mimic or adapt existing examples as well as talk through challenges and questions with colleagues. But currently there is no effective way to do this around data, data skills, and data literacy for educators in grades 3-12+ so instead we are all trying to reinvent the wheel by ourselves. 

The Solution:

The Dataspire PLC project will develop a mechanism and culture for educators in grades 3-16 to build an online professional learning community around data literacy so that they can confidently integrate data, data skills, and data literacy instruction into their teaching practice. Accomplishing this vision will require creating a space in which as a community we can actively leverage lessons learned from both researchers and practitioners to inform, grow, and improve our practice in collaborative and transparent ways.

Who am I?

I am the Director of Dataspire an organization dedicated to inspiring science and data literacy. I am currenly participating in the Mozilla Open Leaders 7 - Culture Track to better learn how to build and effectively engage communities so they can work together to develop tools and resources for the greater good.

What do I need?

Your help in designing and developing a mechanism to support such a community.

Educators to participate in the online professional learning community and make it their own.

I'd love any and all feedback along the way.
